-   :material-brain: **Fundamentals**

    Discrete mathematics, logic, data structures, complexity, and algorithm design.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Go to Fundamentals](general-overview.md)

-   :material-cpu-64-bit: **Computing and Systems**

    Architecture, operating systems, concurrency, networks, distributed systems, containers, and cloud.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Go to Systems](general-overview.md)

-   :material-domain: **Software Architecture**

    Styles (layered, hexagonal, microservices), patterns (CQRS, EDA), quality (modularity, scalability, observability), and documentation (C4).

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Go to Software Architecture](general-overview.md)

-   :material-hammer-wrench: **Software Development**

    Linux, shell, Git, testing, quality, packaging, CI/CD, and best practices.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Go to Development](general-overview.md)

-   :material-server: **Infra & DevOps (optional)**

    Docker/Podman, basic Kubernetes, observability, logging/metrics/tracing.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Go to Infra](general-overview.md)

-   :material-abacus: **Data Science & HPC (optional)**

    NumPy, vectorization, parallelism, GPU (intro), data pipelines.

## Suggested Paths

=== "Basic Path (60–90 h)"
    1. Fundamentals → Discrete Math → Data Structures & Complexity
    2. Systems → OS → Networks
    3. Practice → Linux → Git → Testing

=== "Systems Path (90–120 h)"
    1. Fundamentals → Data Structures/Complexity
    2. Systems → OS/Concurrency → Distributed
    3. Infra → Containers → Observability

=== "Computational Path (90–120 h)"
    1. Fundamentals → Data Structures/Complexity
    2. DS/HPC → Vectorization → GPU (intro)
    3. Practice → CI/CD
